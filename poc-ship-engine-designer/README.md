# Multiplayer naval warfare and ship design simulator

The concept for this game is an optionally multiplayer ship design and naval tactical and strategic warfare simulator. Players will take the role of fleet admirals/administrations in charge of designing, comissioning and then commanding warships. Players will design ships using a ship designer that uses simplified but well design calculations to produce realistic ship designs spannig the 1950s to the 1990s, evolving all the way from gun armed, steam powered post-war ships to missile armed, gas turbine powered modern warships. Players will then be able to use their designed ships in tactical and strategic naval warfare against other players or AI opponents. The game will feature a single player campaign mode, as well as multiplayer modes for competitive and cooperative play. The initial proof of concept game will be developed using web game technologies. Artistic direction will favour simple visuals over complex models, with ships being represented by simple but well designed top-down 2d sprites (like in RTW games). The game will be developed using a modular architecture, allowing for easy expansion and addition of new features in the future. The game will also feature a robust ship design system, allowing players to experiment with different ship configurations and see the impact of their design choices on the performance of their ships in combat. Overall, the goal of this game is to provide an engaging and educational experience for players interested in naval warfare and ship design, while also offering a fun and competitive multiplayer experience.

## Key MVP features

- Ship designer with a wide range of components and design options, allowing players to create a variety of ship designs.
- Realistic ship performance calculations based on the player's design choices, including factors such as speed, range, armament, and armor.
- Tactical combat system that allows players to command their ships in real-time battles against AI opponents or other players.
- Strategic campaign mode that allows players to manage their fleet and resources over time, making decisions about ship construction, deployment, and combat.
- Multiplayer modes for competitive and cooperative play, allowing players to test their ship designs and tactical skills against others.

## Future features

- Additional ship classes and components, such as submarines, aircraft carriers, and advanced missile systems.
- More complex strategic gameplay elements, such as diplomacy, resource management, and fleet logistics.
- Enhanced graphics and visual effects for a more immersive gaming experience.
- Modding support to allow players to create and share their own ship designs and game content.

## Development roadmap

1. Develop the core ship designer system, including a wide range of components and design options, as well as realistic performance calculations.
2. Implement the tactical combat system, allowing players to command their ships in real-time battles against AI opponents using formations, commands and tactics. Ships will have a certain level of random autonomy, allowing them to react to the battle situation and execute basic maneuvers and actions on their own, while still allowing players to issue orders and commands to influence their behavior.
3. Create the strategic campaign mode, allowing players to manage their fleet and resources over time.
4. Add multiplayer modes for competitive and cooperative play, allowing players to test their ship designs and tactical skills against others.
5. Continuously expand and improve the game with additional features, ship classes, and components based on player feedback and demand.

## Technologies used

- Web game development technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the core game development.
- A game engine or framework such as Phaser or PixiJS for handling game mechanics, rendering, and user input.
- A backend server technology such as Node.js for handling multiplayer functionality and game state management.
- A database system such as MongoDB or MySQL for storing player data, ship designs, and game progress.
- Version control systems like Git for managing code changes and collaboration among developers.
- Project management tools like Trello or Jira for organizing tasks and tracking development progress. Overall, the development of this game will require a combination of web development skills, game design expertise, and knowledge of naval warfare and ship design principles to create an engaging and educational gaming experience for players.
- Github Copilot for code generation and assistance during development.

## Conclusion

This game aims to provide an engaging and educational experience for players interested in naval warfare and ship design, while also offering a fun and competitive multiplayer experience. By focusing on a modular architecture and continuous expansion, the game will be able to evolve and grow over time, providing players with new content and features to explore. With a dedicated development team and a clear roadmap, this game has the potential to become a popular title among fans of naval warfare and strategy games.
